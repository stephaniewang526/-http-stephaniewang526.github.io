                    One of the principal aims of the Society is to educate and provide clinicians caring for women affected by
                    androgen excess with the most up to date information regarding these disorders. Clinicians interested in the
                    treatment of these women are encouraged to become a member of the Society.

                <p>
                    The society was founded with the purpose of fostering and focusing greater research in the area of androgen excess disorders
                    research, and is committed to continuing these efforts.The Society sponsors the presentation of cutting edge science
                    at its annual and international meetings. These meetings also serve as forums for the open interaction of all
                    attendees, fostering collaborations and the development of new ideas and concepts. In order to assist researchers
                    to keep up with new scientific developments, a quarterly summary and review of the literature is made available to
                    all members of the Society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Society posts some special job search that regard researchers in the field of androgen excess disorderds.

                <p>
                    Finally, the Society works with and educates funding agencies, providing information and facts, to encourage the
                    development of targeted research funding in this important area of research. As the Society strongly feels that
                    fostering the growth of the next generation of researchers is a critical part of its mission, Travel Awards for
                    Young Investigators to our Annual Meetings have been established. In addition, an innovative category of membership
                    was created to facilitate membership by researchers residing in underdeveloped countries.
